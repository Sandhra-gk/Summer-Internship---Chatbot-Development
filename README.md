# Summer Internship - Chatbot Development

The summer internship project involved the development of a chatbot solution for Hamad International Airport to assist passengers with their inquiries and provide real-time support. The chatbot, accessible via WhatsApp, supports both text and voice messages and utilizes technologies such as TensorFlow for natural language processing. It offers multilingual capabilities. The solution includes a MongoDB database for storing flight and passenger data. 
To manage conversations and interactions, the chatbot was integrated with Chatwoot. Chatwoot provided a dashboard view where chatbot conversations could be tracked and managed. Additionally, the dashboard view of Chatwoot was made accessible in Webex, allowing real agents to view and participate in conversations with users who preferred human assistance over the chatbot.
